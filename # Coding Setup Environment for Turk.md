# Coding Setup Environment for Turkish Kebab Website

## Project Overview
This document outlines the setup for developing a simple, responsive website for "Turkish Kebab," a small restaurant in Sai Kung, Hong Kong. The site will showcase Chef Mustafa Koca’s 45 years of Turkish gastronomy expertise, with sections for About Us, Menu, Recipes, and Reservation. The focus is on a modern, sleek, and fast-loading design using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## Tools and Environment
- **Code Editor**: Visual Studio Code (or any preferred editor like Sublime Text or Cursor).
- **Version Control**: Git (optional but recommended) with a repository hosted on GitHub or GitLab.
- **Browser**: Google Chrome (for testing and DevTools) and Firefox (for cross-browser compatibility).
- **Live Server**: Use the "Live Server" extension in VS Code or a similar tool for real-time preview during development.


- **File Structure**:

turkish-kebab-website/
├── index.html         # Main homepage
├── styles.css         # CSS for styling
├── script.js          # JavaScript for interactivity
├── assets/            # Folder for images, fonts, etc.
│   ├── logo.png       # Restaurant logo (to be provided or placeholder)
│   ├── chef.jpg       # Image of Chef Mustafa Koca (to be provided or placeholder)
│   └── food.jpg       # Sample food image (to be provided or placeholder)
└── README.md          # Project documentation


- **Testing**: Ensure responsiveness using Chrome DevTools (mobile and desktop views).

## Development Guidelines
- Use vanilla HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript (no frameworks like React or Bootstrap to keep it simple and lightweight).
- Optimize for speed: Compress images, minify CSS/JS, and avoid heavy libraries.
- Ensure compatibility with modern browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge).
- Follow semantic HTML for accessibility (e.g., `<header>`, `<nav>`, `<section>`).

## Setup Steps
1. Create the project folder `turkish-kebab-website`.
2. Initialize the file structure as outlined above.
3. Install the Live Server extension in VS Code.
4. Open the project folder in your editor and start coding `index.html`.
5. Test regularly on both desktop and mobile views during development.

## Next Steps
Proceed to the frontend design (`frontend.md`) after setting up the environment.
